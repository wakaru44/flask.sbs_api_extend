# Flask Minimalistic Boilerplate

Minimal, with just a few add-ons: 

    flask-mongoengine
    Flask
    Jinja2
    MarkupSafe
    Flask-Script
    Flask-WTF
    flask-csrf

Enough to build a quick dead-simple api, or a dummy webserver.

Start by putting stuff in /app

# TODO

list of pending changes:

- add skeleton CSS examples
- clean the main a bit
- delete helpers debris
